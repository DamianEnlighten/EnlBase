#Src

The `Src` folder is the base for the development website code.  Larger engagements may subdivide this further by website/project, and have each website/project folder contain the code for that website/project.

Simple:

    Src
      |-css
      |-images
      |-js

Complex:

    Src
      |-Website1
          |-css
          |-images
          |-js
      |-Website2
          |-css
          |-images
          |-js
      |-Project1
          |-css
          |-images
          |-js
